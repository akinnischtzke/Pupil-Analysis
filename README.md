# Pupil-Analysis
MATLAB code for tracking and measuring mouse pupil during experiment

This code will track both the location (centroid) and the diamter of the pupil of a mouse eye. Pupil diameter changes with the behavior of the animal (e.g. increases during locomotion, decreases during sleep/quiesence) and serves as a reliable physiological readout of the internal brain state of the animal.

To run:

- run the GUI file (analyzePupilSetup_gui.m) which will guide you through the steps and parameters for analyzing the video. 
- the file 'pupilTracking.m' contains the basic analysis steps.
